## User Journey
The landing page supports three primary personas:
1. **Attendee** → Wants event info, trends, quick registration.  
2. **Exhibitor** → Looks for exhibitor benefits, booth info, application form.  
3. **Press** → Needs accreditation, schedule, and press resources.  

See: [`docs/user-journey/`](./docs/user-journey/)

## Design Workflow
1. User journey Mapping - docs - Figjam
2. Wireframing - lo-fi wireframe (used Figma)
3. Prototyping - hi-fi visuals with branding assets (Adobe XD)
4. Development - React js + CSS
5. Deployment - Github Pages
