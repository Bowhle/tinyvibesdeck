# Tiny Vibes Deck
_Always learning, always building_ :)

This repo is my **code/design playground** — a growing collection of small projects, snippets, and mashups that blend **UI/UX design** and **frontend development**.  
It’s bold, it’s simple, and it’s all about learning tiny steps that create big vibes. :)

**Live Demo**: [Tiny Vibes Deck on GitHub Pages](https://bowhle.github.io/tinyvibesdeck) *(coming soon)*  
**Repo**: [tinyvibesdeck](https://github.com/bowhle/tinyvibesdeck) *(coming soon)*

## Projects Inside
- **[Cinegear World](./cinegear-world)** - a one page landing site for an international trade exhibition complete with journey maps, personas, wireframes, and a React implementation.
- **Tiny Vibes Deck (core)** — design-driven card UI with sticky header navigation and bold typography (currently in progress).  
- *(more projects coming soon!)*

---

## Tech Stack
- React.js (Create React App, `.js` files)  
- Plain CSS (responsive, mobile-first)  
- GitHub Pages (deployment for demos)

---

## Features Across projects
- Sticky header with dropdown menus (keyboard + ESC to close)  
- Bold hero headline with oversized typography  
- Pure CSS “cards” for visual punch (no images)  
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Modal interactions for forms and CTAs

---

## What I'm learning
- Structuring a React project with simple, reusable components  
- Managing state with hooks like `useState` and small custom hooks  
- Accessibility basics (focus states, ARIA, keyboard navigation, Screen reader support)  
- Deploying React apps to GitHub Pages  
- How design choices (contrast, whitespace, typography) shape the UX
- Prototyping using Figma and Adobe XD

## About This Repo
I’m learning frontend development by building **tiny, shippable projects** that mix dev + design.    

If you have ideas for fun prompts or design tweaks, open an issue or drop me a message — I’d love to keep iterating. :)
