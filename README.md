# Tiny Vibes Deck

This is one of my favourite **code/design mashup projects**.  
It’s bold, it’s simple, and it’s all about learning tiny steps that create big vibes. :)

## About This Project
I’m learning frontend development by building **tiny, shippable projects** that mix dev + design.    

If you have ideas for fun prompts or design tweaks, open an issue or drop me a message — I’d love to keep iterating. :)
